# FetchPoints

## _Points System for Fetch_

A system to gain or utilize points via transactions

## Features

- Commit (multiple) transactions
- Give points to payers
- Use points (optional: from certain payers)
- Return a list of points from payers

## Tech

FetchPoints uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Flask] - Micro Web Framework which utilizes Python 
- [PyMongo] - Establishes connection with MongoDB via Python

## Installation

FetchPoints requires Flask and PyMongo to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
pip install pymongo Flask
```

## Usage

Run app.py to start the server up.

| Route              | Required                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
|`/api/spend_points` | `int` Amount                 |
|`/api/give_points`  | `int` Amount, `string` payer |
|`/api/balance`      | `None`                       |

`api/spend_points` - Spends points based on amount given. 

`api/give_points` - Get points from payer based on amount

`api/balance` - Returns the amount of points from each payer


## Testing

To run the test cases, you have to run the app.py first then run the test.py. 

`WARNING`: Testing resets the database so only do this during development.
